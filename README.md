# Gis-project-with-kotlin
The goal of our initiative is to find a long-lost treasure. 
To find the hidden gold, you must first realize that the location of the treasure is unknown. 
Our software works with your directions to assist you find it by selecting random areas on the map, each of which is identified by a colored line.
When I click on one location, we see that the light black (GRAY) click is the furthest away from my current location for me, 
so it appears light black; seconds after I update my current location, we see the line change to blue, 
indicating that the distance has decreased; and after Automatic update of the current site again, 
we see the color change to yellow, indicating that the distance has increased; 
and thus the calculation is done with the gradation of colors, and the distance is calculated with the gradation of colors.
Until we approach the red color, which means we've arrived at or are close to the random location (the treasure). 
The calculating procedure continues even if the device is not moving since the current position is 
updated every few seconds and the device changes its dimensions in line with the satellites.
